//GET Request -> used to retrieve remote data

//GET ROUTE 1 - When get request is made to root folder, serve the home page browser
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    // Below was template Udacity code
    //res.sendFile(path.resolve('src/client/views/index.html'))

//GET ROUTE 2 - When get request is made to /test, Test connection between Server & Client by calling mockAPIResponse Function
app.get('/test', function (req, res) {

//POST Route 
//When POST request is made to the /callAPI Route, call the callAPI asynch function
